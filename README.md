# Breast Cancer Prediction using Decision Trees
This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using Decision Trees algorithm. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment and improved prognosis. This project utilizes a dataset containing various features derived from breast cancer biopsies to train a Decision Trees model, which can then predict the probability of breast cancer occurrence.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [XYZ source] and contains a variety of features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, fractal dimension, and diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign). The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the quality of input data for training the Decision Trees model.
